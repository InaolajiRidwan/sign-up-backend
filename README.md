🔑 Keywords & Concepts
🟢 MongoDB

🗄️ Database: A NoSQL database used to store data in JSON-like documents.

📂 Collection: Similar to a table in SQL; holds multiple documents.

📑 Document: A single record in MongoDB, stored in key-value pairs (like JSON).

📝 Schema: Defines the structure of a document (used in Mongoose).

🔄 CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete – basic operations on the database.

🆔 ObjectId: Unique identifier automatically assigned to each document.

⚡ Express.js

🚀 Express: A Node.js web framework for building APIs and servers.

🌐 Route: Defines the endpoint (URL) and HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

📥 Request (req): Data coming from the client (e.g., body, params, query).

📤 Response (res): Data sent back from the server to the client.

🛠️ Middleware: Functions that run between the request and response (e.g., logging, authentication).

🐹 Mongoose

🔗 ODM (Object Data Modeling): A library to connect MongoDB with Node.js.

🏗️ Model: A constructor compiled from a Schema that creates and manages documents.

✅ Validation: Ensures data meets specific rules before being saved.

🤝 Populate: A method to link documents across collections (like relationships).

🌍 dotenv

🔐 Environment Variables: Securely store sensitive information (API keys, database URLs, secrets).

📄 .env file: File where environment variables are stored (not pushed to GitHub).

💻 process.env: The way to access variables in Node.js.

🛡️ Middleware

⚙️ Application-level middleware: Applied to all routes (e.g., app.use(express.json())).

🎯 Route-level middleware: Applied to specific routes.

🚨 Error-handling middleware: Catches and handles errors ((err, req, res, next)).

🔒 bcryptjs

🔑 Hashing: Converts passwords into an unreadable format before storing.

🧂 Salt: Random data added to the password before hashing to strengthen security.

🔍 Compare: Verifies entered password against the stored hash.

🛡️ Security: Ensures passwords are not stored in plain text
